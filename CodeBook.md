##UCI HAR dataset codebook

This describes the variables and the processing performing in analysis of the data.

Very simply, all input, including variable names, originates from the UCI HAR dataset itself.
Specifically, the file `features_info.txt` in the dataset describes the meanings of each of 
the variable names in detail.
These are the variable names (of the feature vector) given in the file `features.txt`.

The processing that has been applied is to:

1. extract all variables that relates to a mean or standard deviation
of a quantity (feature variable names that contain "mean" or "std"),
2. group each of these over the subject and activity labels,
3. and calculate the mean of each group.

The column names in the output data set relate exactly to the input feature column names (as catalogued in
`features.txt` and described in `features_info.txt` as well as below), but for
appending ".Group_Mean" to the variable name to denote that the quantity is the mean over
the subject/activity grouping.

For completeness, in the event this, along with the output tidy data set is being read without
access to the original UCI HAR data set, the content of features_info.txt is included below to 
describe the meaning of the variable names. Note, not all variable names are present in the
data set output from `run_analysis.R`, only those that pertain to a mean or standard deviation.

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
